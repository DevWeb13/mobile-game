# Token Clash – Game Design Document (GDD)

## 1. Game Overview
- **Working Title:** Token Clash (placeholder)
- **Platform:** iOS / Android
- **Genre:** Casual, skill-based competitive
- **Session Length:** 30 seconds – 2 minutes
- **Target Audience:**
  - Ages 16–45
  - Casual & mid-core
  - Players who enjoy competition, progression, and visible rewards
- **Core Promise:**
  - “Risk your tokens, test your skill, climb leagues, and win big — fast.”

## 2. Core Game Concept
Short skill-based matches where players stake tokens to enter, perform a simple action, and win or lose tokens based on performance.

- **No story dependency**
- **No complex controls**
- **No grinding without purpose**

**Only:**
- Skill
- Risk
- Progression
- Rewards

## 3. Core Gameplay Mechanic (Example)
**Mechanic:** Precision Timing

- A moving indicator (bar / needle / object)
- One tap at the right moment
- Perfect timing = maximum score
- Bad timing = loss or reduced reward

**Why this works:**
- One-finger input
- Universally understandable
- Skill improves with practice
- Easy to balance
- Easy to theme visually

> Note: Other mechanics can replace this without breaking the economy.

## 4. Match Structure
**Match Duration:** ~20–40 seconds

**Match Flow:**
1. Player selects stake
2. Countdown (1 second)
3. Skill action (tap / timing)
4. Score calculated
5. Result screen:
   - Tokens won or lost
   - Progress bars
   - League points
   - One-tap replay

No menus between matches unless the player chooses to exit.

## 5. Token Economy (Core System)
**Currency:** Tokens (the only mandatory currency)

**Tokens are:**
- Required to play
- Constantly circulating

**Token Sources:**
- Winning matches
- Daily login rewards
- Missions & challenges
- Ads (optional)
- Purchases

**Token Sinks:**
- Match entry fees
- High-stake games
- Cosmetic unlocks
- Event access
- League fees (small %)

This creates healthy economic pressure.

## 6. Stakes & Betting System
**Stake Tiers (Example Values):**

| Tier   | Entry Cost | Potential Reward |
|--------|------------|------------------|
| Low    | 10 tokens  | 18–20 tokens     |
| Medium | 50 tokens  | 90–100 tokens    |
| High   | 200 tokens | 360–400 tokens   |
| Elite  | 1,000 tokens | 1,800–2,000 tokens |

- **House fee:** ~5–10%
- Rewards scale with performance (not pure win/lose)
- Higher leagues unlock higher tiers
- Loss feels fair, wins feel exciting

## 7. League System
**Leagues:**
- Bronze
- Silver
- Gold
- Platinum
- Diamond

**League Rules:**
Each league has:
- Minimum token balance to enter
- Stake limits
- Reward multipliers

**Promotion based on:**
- Win rate
- Consistency

**Demotion** prevents inflation and stagnation.

**Seasonal Reset:**
- Partial reset (not full wipe)
- Rewards paid in tokens + cosmetics

## 8. Progression Systems
Player progression includes:
- League rank
- Visible XP bar
- Titles / badges
- Cosmetic prestige

Progress is always visible:
- After matches
- On home screen
- On leaderboards

**Humans hate invisible progress.**

## 9. Retention Mechanics
**Daily Login Rewards:**
- Day 1: Small tokens
- Day 7: Bigger reward
- Streak resets gently (no punishment)

**Daily Missions (Examples):**
- Win 3 matches
- Play a high-stake game
- Achieve perfect timing

**Weekly Challenges:**
- League-based

- Event participation

Retention is based on habit, not obligation.

## 10. Monetization Strategy (Detailed)
**Token Packs (Example Pricing):**

| Pack   | Tokens  | Price  |
|--------|---------|--------|
| Small  | 500     | $1.99  |
| Medium | 3,000   | $9.99  |
| Large  | 8,000   | $24.99 |
| Mega   | 20,000  | $49.99 |

**Starter Pack (High Conversion):**

- Never forced

**Cosmetics (Pure Vanity):**
